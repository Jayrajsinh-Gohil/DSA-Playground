# DSA Visualization Platform - WebHorizon Hackathon (2nd Runner-up)

Welcome to the **DSA Visualization Platform**, a project developed as part of the "WebHorizon" Hackathon, where our team secured the **2nd Runner-up position** out of 98 teams. This platform aims to make Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) easier to understand through visualizations.

## 📚 Project Overview

This platform is designed to help students grasp various **sorting algorithms** like:

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort
- Counting Sort
- Radix sort
- Linear Search Sort

Each algorithm is accompanied by interactive visualizations to demonstrate its step-by-step execution.

### 🔍 Features

1. **Sorting Algorithm Visualizations**: Learn popular sorting algorithms through animations.
2. **Exercise Page**: Practice your skills with exercises and **interview questions** to prepare for technical interviews.
3. **Resources Page**: Access curated learning materials, tutorials, and guides to deepen your understanding of algorithms and data structures.
